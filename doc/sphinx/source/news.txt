Vx.y.0 (wishes)
----------------

* The circuit API is actually low level. It is fastidious to work with
  and error-prone.  Skidl has a very good approach to make the
  connections between elements.  A clever idea is to make the
  connection through loop, e.g. `gnd & C1 & (R1 | R2) & D1 & vcc`.
* Improve Spice library handling, e.g. we have to read the library
  code to know how to map the pins, etc.
* Unit should be provided by a third party.  We need a library that works well with Spice.

V1.6.0 (development release)
----------------------------

* **New Simulation API**

  .. code-block:: python

       # build a circuit

       # instantiate a simulator
       simulator = Simulator.factory()
       # or
       simulator = Simulator.factory(simulator='ngspice')
       # same as
       simulator = Simulator.factory(simulator='ngspice-shared')

       # create a simulation, it corresponds to the Spice code part with lines starting with ".something ..."
       simulation = simulator.simulation(circuit, temperature=25, nominal_temperature=25)
       # define an analysis and run it
       analysis = simulation.transient(step_time=ac_line.period/200, end_time=ac_line.period*50, log_desk=True)
       # analysis is now Pickable

* Simulation output is now Pickable

* The **Spice parser** was rewritten from scratch using the `PLY <https://www.dabeaz.com/ply>`_
  library, which is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.  The LALR parser
  generates an AST from a BNF grammar written from scratch using the Ngspice manual.  Up to now, it
  only requires a hack to handle the grammar, cf. XSpice vector syntax :code:`[1 -1 -2]` which
  interfere with mathematical expression.  PySpice is now able to parse completely and properly all
  the examples from the Ngspice manual.  However, the processing of the AST does actually the bare
  minimum.
* **KiCadTools** a proof of concept module to read KiCad 6
  `.kicad_sch` schema file and compute the netlist.  *This module can
  be used to perform any kind of processing on a KiCad schema.  It is
  actually hosted in the source but could become a standalone
  project.* For PySpice, it provides a very flexible way to draft a
  circuit with the help of KiCad and then generate the netlist without
  using the netlist export feature of KiCad.  And thus leverage the
  writing of fastidious circuit.
* The most common PySpice parts can be imported from :code:`from PySpice import ...`
* Logging setup code clean-up

V1.4.3 2020-07-04
-----------------

A huge effort, thanks to @stuarteberg Stuart Berg, has been made to make Ngspice and PySpice
available on Anaconda (conda-forge) for the Window, OSX and Linux platforms.  Thanks to the
conda-forge continuous integration platform, we can now run unit tests and the examples on these
platforms automatically.  Hope this will make the software more robust and easier to run !

* PySpice is now available on Anaconda(conda-forge) as well as a wheel on PyPI
* Added a post installation tool to download the Ngspice DLL on Windows and to check the installation.
  It should now simplify considerably the PySpice installation on Windows.
* This tool can also download the examples and the Ngspice PDF manual.
* On Linux and OSX, a Ngspice package is now available on Anaconda(conda-forge).
  Note that theses two platforms do not download a binary from Ngspice since a compiler can easily be installed on these platforms.
* Updated installation documentation for Linux, the main distributions now provide a ngspice shared package.

* Added a front-end website to keep older releases documentation available on the web.
* fixed and rebuilt all examples (but mistakes could happen ...)
* examples are now available as Python files and Jupyter notebooks
  (but some issues must be fixed, e.g. due to the way Jupyter handles Matplotlib plots)

* support NgSpice 32 API (no change)
* removed :code:`@substitution@` in PySpice/__init__.py, beacause it breaks pip install from git
* fixed some logging spams
* fixed NonLinearVoltageSource
* fixed Unicode issue with °C (° is Extended ASCII)
* fixed ffi_string_utf8 for UnicodeDecodeError
* fixed logging formatter for OSX (removed ANSI codes)
* reworded "Invalid plot name" exception
* removed diacritics in example filenames
* cir2py has been converted to an entry point to work on all platforms
* updated Matplotlib subplots in examples
* added a unit example
* added a NMOS example (thanks to cyber-g) cf. #221
